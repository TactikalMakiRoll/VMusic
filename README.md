## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, TailwindCSS, JavaScript, Vue 3, Pinia, Cypress\*, Spotify API, Vite (+Prettier, ESLint)

## Optimizations

As this is a work in progress there is still a lot of functionality that needs to be finished. Current list:

- Adding to favorites (API call)
- Playing the track
- Submenu options functionality
- Search and trending pages

## What's already working

- Home page new user layout (with responsiveness)
- Log in and log out (with state in pinia)
- Clicking "Add to favorites" while logged out produces a warning

## Commit history

I tried to keep commit history as clean as possible so it represents a real business product. Comments to the code will arrive soon
